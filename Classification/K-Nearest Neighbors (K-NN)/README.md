# Machine Learning Project (KNN Classification)

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. Our goal through this project is to guess the type of flower through the information we have.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name       | Data Type    | 
|-------------------|--------------|
| `Id`              | int64      | 
| `SepalLengthCm`   | float64        | 
| `SepalWidthCm`    | float64        | 
| `PetalLengthCm`   | float64        | 
| `PetalWidthCm`    | float64        | 
| `Species`         | object       |
