# Machine Learning Project (Logistic Regression)

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name               | Data Type    | Description                                          |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Pregnancies`             | Integer      | Number of times pregnant                            |
| `Glucose`                 | Integer      | Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test |
| `BloodPressure`           | Integer      | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)                    |
| `SkinThickness`           | Integer      | Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)                    |
| `Insulin`                 | Integer      | 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)                      |
| `BMI`                     | Float        | Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)      |
| `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`| Float        | Diabetes pedigree function                          |
| `Age`                     | Integer      | Age (years)                                         |
| `Outcome`                 | Integer      | Class variable (0 or 1)                             |
