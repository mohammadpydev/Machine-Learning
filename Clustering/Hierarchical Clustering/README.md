# Machine Learning Project (Hierarchical Clustering)

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. There are multiple Attributes or practices in this case on which the happiness score depends on â€“ GDP,Family,Health,Corruption etc. Our aim is to make clusters from this data that can segment similar countries together. We will use Hierarchical Clustering for this problem.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name                    | Data Type |
|--------------------------------|-----------|
| `Overall rank`                 | int64     |
| `Country or region`            | object    |
| `Score`                        | float64   |
| `GDP per capita`               | float64   |
| `Social support`               | float64   |
| `Healthy life expectancy`      | float64   |
| `Freedom to make life choices` | float64   |
| `Generosity`                   | float64   |
| `Perceptions of corruption`    | float64   |
