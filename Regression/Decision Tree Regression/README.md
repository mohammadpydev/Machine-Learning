# Machine Learning Project (Decision Tree Regression)

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. The goal of this model is to Predict crop type based on information.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name       | Data Type    | Description                                          |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `N`   | int64     | ratio of Nitrogen content in soil |
| `P `   | int64     | ratio of Phosphorous content in soil |
| `K `   | int64     |  ratio of Potassium content in soil |
| `temperature `   | float64    | temperature in degree Celsius |
| `humidity`   | float64    | relative humidity in % |
| `ph`   | float64    | ph value of the soil |
| `rainfall`   | float64    | rainfall in mm |
| `label `   | String    | Crop Recommendation|
