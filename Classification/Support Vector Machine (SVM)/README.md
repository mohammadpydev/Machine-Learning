# Machine Learning Project (Support Vector Machine (SVM))

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. The aim of this project is to study the classification of Pumpkin Seeds ‘‘Urgup_Sivrisi’’ and ‘‘Cercevelik’’

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name          | Data Type |
|----------------------|-----------|
| `Area`               | int64     |
| `Perimeter`          | float64   |
| `Major_Axis_Length`  | float64   |
| `Minor_Axis_Length`  | float64   |
| `Convex_Area`        | int64     |
| `Equiv_Diameter`     | float64   |
| `Eccentricity`       | float64   |
| `Solidity`           | float64   |
| `Extent`             | float64   |
| `Roundness`          | float64   |
| `Aspect_Ration`      | float64   |
| `Compactness`        | float64   |
| `Class`              | object    |
