# Machine Learning Project (Random Forest Classification)

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. Through this project, we aim to classify houses in Paris according to the information we have.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name         | Data Type |
|---------------------|-----------|
| `squareMeters`      | int64     |
| `numberOfRooms`     | int64     |
| `hasYard`           | int64     |
| `hasPool`           | int64     |
| `floors`            | int64     |
