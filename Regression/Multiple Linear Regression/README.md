# Machine Learning Project (Multiple Linear Regression)


## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. The goal is to predict the quality of wine based on the information we have.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name       | Data Type    |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `fixed acidity`   | float64     | 
| `volatile acidity `   | float64     | 
| `citric acid `   | float64     |
| `residual sugar`   | float64    |
| `chlorides`   | float64    |
| `free sulfur dioxide`   | float64    |
| `total sulfur dioxide`   | float64    |
| `density`   | float64    |
| `pH `   | float64    |
| `sulphates  `   | float64    |
| `alcohol`   | float64    |
| `quality`   | int64    |
