# Machine Learning Project (Simple linear regression)


## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. The goal is to study the relationship between Years of Experience and Salary.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name       | Data Type    |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `Years of Experience`   | float64     | 
| `Salary`   | float64     |
