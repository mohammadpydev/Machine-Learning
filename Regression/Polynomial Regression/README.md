# Machine Learning Project (Polynomail Regression )


## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. The goal is to study the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name       | Data Type    |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `Temperature (Â°C)`   | float64     | 
| `Ice Cream Sales`   | float64     | 


## Data Source
The following data file was used in this project:

- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirajdeepbhandari/polynomial-regression/data)


## Requirements
- [Python 3.x]
- [Required libraries (seaborn, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn,)]
