# Machine Learning Project (Decision Tree Classification)

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. Our goal through this project is to classify mushrooms  suitable for eating, based on the information we have.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name                | Data Type |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| `class`                    | object    |
| `cap-shape`                | object    |
| `cap-surface`              | object    |
| `cap-color`                | object    |
| `bruises`                  | object    |
| `odor`                     | object    |
| `gill-attachment`          | object    |
| `gill-spacing`             | object    |
| `gill-size`                | object    |
| `gill-color`               | object    |
