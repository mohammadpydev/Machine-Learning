# Machine Learning Project (K-Means Clustering)

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. Our goal through this module is to classify some of data we have using the unsupervised module.

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name       | Data Type |
|-------------------|-----------|
| `city`            | object    |
| `city_ascii`      | object    |
| `lat`             | float64   |
| `lng`             | float64   |
| `country`         | object    |
| `iso2`            | object    |
| `iso3`            | object    |
| `admin_name`      | object    |
| `capital`         | object    |
| `population`      | float64   |
| `id`              | int64     |
