# Machine Learning Project (Kernel SVM)

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model using specific data. we wat in this project to Predicting the type of star based on the actual information we have

## Data fields

The database contain of the following columns:

| Column Name                                     | Data Type |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `Mean of the integrated profile`                | float64   |
| `Standard deviation of the integrated profile`  | float64   |
| `Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile`     | float64   |
| `Skewness of the integrated profile`            | float64   |
| `Mean of the DM-SNR curve`                      | float64   |
| `Standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve`        | float64   |
| `Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve`           | float64   |
| `Skewness of the DM-SNR curve`                  | float64   |
| `target_class`                                  | int64     |
